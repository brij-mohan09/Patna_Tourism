        <p>The capital city of Bihar located at the southern bank of the river Ganga, Patna is the largest town of the state. The history of this city stretches beyond 2500 years back. The ancient name of this city was Pataliputra which remained as the capital of Magadha under multiple dynasties for about thousand years.</p>
        <p>Patna (/ˈpætnə, ˈpʌt-/[13] Hindi: [ˈpəʈnaː] (listen)), historically known as Pataliputra,[14] is the capital and largest city of the state of Bihar in India.[1] According to the United Nations, as of 2018, Patna had a population of 2.35 million,[15] making it the 19th largest city in India.[1] Covering 250 square kilometres (97 sq mi) and over 2.5 million people, its urban agglomeration is the 18th largest in India. Patna serves as the seat of Patna High Court. The Buddhist, Hindu and Jain pilgrimage centres of Vaishali, Rajgir, Nalanda, Bodh Gaya and Pawapuri are nearby and Patna City is a sacred city for Sikhs as the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh was born here.[16] The modern city of Patna is mainly on the southern bank of the river Ganges. The city also straddles the rivers Sone, Gandak and Punpun. The city is approximately 35 kilometres (22 mi) in length and 16 to 18 kilometres (9.9 to 11.2 mi) wide.</p>
        <p>One of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world,[17] Patna was founded in 490 BCE by the king of Magadha. Ancient Patna, known as Pataliputra, was the capital of the Magadha Empire throughout the Haryanka, Nanda, Mauryan, Shunga, Gupta, and Pala dynasties. Pataliputra was a seat of learning and fine arts. It was home to many astronomers and scholars including Aryabhata, Vātsyāyana and Chanakya.[18][19] During the Maurya period (around 300 BCE) its population was about 400,000.[20] Patna served as the seat of power, and political and cultural centre of the Indian subcontinent during the Maurya and Gupta empires.[21] With the fall of the Gupta Empire, Patna lost its glory. It was revived again in the 17th century by the British as a centre of international trade. Following the partition of Bengal presidency in 1912, Patna became the capital of Bihar and Orissa Province.[22]</p>
        <p>Until the 19th century it was a major trading and commercial hub in India.[23] After independence there were a few downturns but its economy was still stable.[24] After the separation of Jharkhand from Bihar, it lost its glory.[25] Now trials are made to develop the city.[26] As per the Directorate of Economics and Statistics (Government of Bihar), Nominal GDP of Patna District was estimated at INR 63,176.55 crores in 2011-12.[12][27] As of 2011-12, Patna already recorded per capita gross domestic product of ₹1,08,657, way ahead of many other Indian cities and state capitals.[12][28] Using figures for assumed average annual growth, Patna is the 21st fastest growing city in the world and 5th fastest growing city in India according to a study by the City Mayors Foundation. Patna registered an average annual growth of 3.72% during 2006–2010.[29] As of 2011-12, GDP per capita of Patna is ₹1,08,657 and its GDP growth rate is 7.29 per cent. In June 2009, the World Bank ranked Patna second in India (after Delhi) for ease of starting a business.[30]</p>
        <h4>Ancient Era</h4>
        <p>Traditional Buddhist literature attributes foundation of Patna 490 BCE[38][39] as Ajatashatru, the king of Magadha, wanted to shift his capital from the hilly Rajagrha (today Rajgir) to a strategically chosen place to better combat the Licchavis of Vaishali.[40] He chose the site on the bank of the Ganges and fortified the area. Gautama Buddha travelled through this place in the last year of his life. He prophesied a great future for this place even as he predicted its ruin due to flood, fire and feud.[41] According to Dieter Schlingloff, the Buddhist accounts may have presented the grandeur of Patna as a prophecy and that its wooden fortifications, unlike other early historic Indian cities, indicate that it might be much older than thought but only archaeological excavation and C14 dates of its wooden palisades which is presently lacking may establish this.[42]</p>
        <h4>Mauryan Empire</h4>
        <p>Megasthenes, the Indo-Greek historian and ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya, gave one of the earliest accounts of the city. He wrote that the city was on the confluence of the rivers Ganga and Arennovoas (Sonabhadra – Hiranyawah) and was 14 kilometres (9 mi) long and 2.82 kilometres (1.75 mi) wide.[43][44] Megasthenes, the Greek ambassador to India, described the city as the greatest city on earth during its heyday.[45] The Shungas ultimately retained control of Pataliputra and ruled for almost 100 years. The Shungas were followed by the Kanvas and eventually by the Guptas.[46] A number of Chinese travellers came to India in pursuit of knowledge and recorded their observations about Pataliputra in their travelogues. One such famous account was recorded by a Chinese Buddhist traveller Fa Hien, who visited India between 399 and 414 CE, and stayed here for many months translating Buddhist texts.[47] When Chinese Buddhist Monk Faxian visited the city in 400 A.D, he found the people to be rich and prosperous; they practised virtue and justice. He found that the nobles and householders of the city had constructed several hospitals in which the poor of all countries, the destitute, the crippled and the diseased can get treatment. They could receive every kind of help gratuitously. Physicians would inspect the diseases, and order them food, drink, and medicines.[48][page needed]</p>
